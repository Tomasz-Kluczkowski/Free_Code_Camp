                <h3 class="text-left">A Brief Look at Steve's Life</h3>
                <p class="text-left">Steve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa.

                <p class="mt-3 text-left">In September 1990, Vai released Passion and Warfare through Relativity Records, and within the first week of release, the album had reached number 18 in the Billboard 200, selling over a million and a half copies worldwide. Passion and Warfare won Vai a number of awards such as Guitar World and Guitar Player's "Best Album" and "Best Rock Guitarist" awards. Passion and Warfare has been cited as one of the most pertinent instrumental albums released.</p>
